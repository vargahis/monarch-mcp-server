# Phase 5 — Tag CRUD (13 tests)

**Important:** After every successful `create_transaction_tag` call, immediately append the returned tag ID to `created_resources.tags` in the state file before running the next test.

---

## Test 5.1 — get_transaction_tags: List All Tags

**Tool call:**
```
get_transaction_tags()
```

**Expected:** A list of tags (may be empty if no tags exist). Each tag should have `id`, `name`, and `color` fields.

**Validation:** Response is a list. If non-empty, each item has `id` and `name` fields.

**Cleanup:** None.

---

## Test 5.2 — create_transaction_tag: Happy Path

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(name = "MCP-Test-Tag", color = "#FF5733")
```

**Expected:** Returns a tag object with `id`, `name` = "MCP-Test-Tag", and `color` = "#FF5733".

**Validation:**
- Response contains an `id` field.
- `name` matches "MCP-Test-Tag".
- `color` matches "#FF5733" (case-insensitive).

**Immediately after:** Add the returned `id` to `created_resources.tags`. Save this ID as `{created_tag_id}` for use in tests 5.7, 5.11, 5.13.

**Cleanup:** Will be deleted in cleanup phase.

---

## Test 5.3 — create_transaction_tag: Invalid Color ("red")

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(name = "MCP-Test-BadColor", color = "red")
```

**Expected:** A validation error indicating the color format is invalid.

**Validation:** Response is a string containing "error", "invalid", "color", "hex", or "format" (case-insensitive).

**Cleanup:** If a tag was created despite the error, add its ID to `created_resources.tags`.

---

## Test 5.4 — create_transaction_tag: Short Hex ("#F00")

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(name = "MCP-Test-ShortHex", color = "#F00")
```

**Expected:** A validation error indicating the color must be a full 6-digit hex.

**Validation:** Response is a string containing "error", "invalid", "color", "hex", or "format" (case-insensitive). OR if the API accepts 3-digit hex, the tag is created successfully — in that case add the ID to `created_resources.tags`.

**Cleanup:** If a tag was created, add its ID to `created_resources.tags`.

---

## Test 5.5 — create_transaction_tag: Empty Name

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(name = "", color = "#FF5733")
```

**Expected:** An error indicating the name cannot be empty.

**Validation:** Response is a string containing "error", "empty", "name", "required", or "blank" (case-insensitive).

**Cleanup:** If a tag was created despite the error, add its ID to `created_resources.tags`.

---

## Test 5.6 — create_transaction_tag: Whitespace Name

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(name = "   ", color = "#FF5733")
```

**Expected:** An error indicating the name cannot be empty/whitespace.

**Validation:** Response is a string containing "error", "empty", "name", "required", "blank", or "whitespace" (case-insensitive). OR if the API accepts whitespace names, record as PASS (observation) and add ID to `created_resources.tags`.

**Cleanup:** If a tag was created, add its ID to `created_resources.tags`.

---

## Test 5.7 — create_transaction_tag: Duplicate Name

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(name = "MCP-Test-Tag", color = "#33FF57")
```

**Note:** This uses the same name as test 5.2 but a different color.

**Expected:** Observe behavior — either:
- The API rejects duplicates (error string), OR
- The API allows duplicates (returns a new tag with a different ID).

**Validation:** Either an error string OR a valid tag object with an `id`. This is an observation test — record what happens.

**Cleanup:** If a tag was created, add its ID to `created_resources.tags`.

---

## Test 5.8 — create_transaction_tag: Unicode Name

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(name = "MCP-Test-テスト-🏷️", color = "#5733FF")
```

**Expected:** Either succeeds (tag created) or returns a graceful error.

**Validation:** Response is either a valid tag object with `id` field, OR an error string. No crash.

**Cleanup:** If a tag was created, add its ID to `created_resources.tags`.

---

## Test 5.9 — create_transaction_tag: Long Name (200+ chars)

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(
  name  = "MCP-Test-LongName-" + "A" * 200,
  color = "#FF3357"
)
```

Use a name that is "MCP-Test-LongName-" followed by 200 "A" characters (total ~218 chars).

**Expected:** Either succeeds or returns a graceful error about name length.

**Validation:** Response is either a valid tag object with `id` field, OR an error string. No crash.

**Cleanup:** If a tag was created, add its ID to `created_resources.tags`.

---

## Test 5.10 — create_transaction_tag: Special Characters

**Tool call:**
```
create_transaction_tag(name = "MCP-Test-&'\"<>", color = "#33FFAA")
```

**Expected:** Either succeeds (special chars stored literally) or returns a graceful error.

**Validation:** Response is either a valid tag object with `id` field, OR an error string. No crash. If created, verify the name is stored (may be HTML-encoded or literal).

**Cleanup:** If a tag was created, add its ID to `created_resources.tags`.

---

## Test 5.11 — delete_transaction_tag: Happy Path

**Prerequisite:** `{created_tag_id}` from test 5.2 must exist.

**Tool call:**
```
delete_transaction_tag(tag_id = "{created_tag_id}")
```

**Expected:** A success response, typically `{deleted: true}` or a confirmation string.

**Validation:** Response indicates successful deletion. Contains "deleted", "success", or `true`.

**Cleanup:** Remove `{created_tag_id}` from `created_resources.tags` (already deleted).

---

## Test 5.12 — delete_transaction_tag: Invalid ID

**Tool call:**
```
delete_transaction_tag(tag_id = "invalid-tag-id-00000")
```

**Expected:** A graceful error indicating the tag was not found.

**Validation:** Response is an error string. No unhandled exception.

**Cleanup:** None.

---

## Test 5.13 — delete_transaction_tag: Already-Deleted ID

**Prerequisite:** `{created_tag_id}` from test 5.2 was deleted in test 5.11.

**Tool call:**
```
delete_transaction_tag(tag_id = "{created_tag_id}")
```

**Expected:** A graceful error indicating the tag no longer exists.

**Validation:** Response is an error string or indicates "not found" / "already deleted". No crash.

**Cleanup:** None.
